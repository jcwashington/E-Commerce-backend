  ## Description
  Here I have built the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This is the user story:

  ```md
    AS A manager at an internet retail company
    I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
    SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
  ```

  Technologies Utilized:
  Express.js, Javascript, MySQL, Sequelize and dotenv npm packages, Postman

                "id": 1,
                "product_name": "Plain T-Shirt",
                "price": 15,
